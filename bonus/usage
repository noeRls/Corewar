USAGE
	./corewar [-dump nbr_cycle] [[-n prog_number] [-a load_address] prog_name] ...

DESCRIPTION
	-dump nbr_cycle	dumps the memory after the nbr_cycle execution (if the round isn't
	      		already over) with the following format:  32 bytes/line in
			hexadecimal (A0BCDEFE1DD3...)
	-n prog_number	sets the next program's number. By default, the first free number
	   		in the parameter order
	-a load_address	sets the next program's loading address. When no addreess is
	   		specified, optimize the addresses so that the processes are as far
			away from each other as possible. The addresses are MEM_SIZE modulo
